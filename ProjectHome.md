From the depths a light shall rise, a star of hope for all the World. As a darkness gathers, it shall stand mighty as the blade, and be the shield that shelters as well as the spear that drives to the heart of evil. Yet, as this light will shine, darkness will slither like a tendril of hate, like a fatal disease, and the star will be its slave. Alas, this is the fate of all things, yet most beautiful cruelty is in the fall of Numenor.



A (long) while ago, I thought about creating a Battle for Middle-earth II expansion, based around and faithful to the story of AkallabÃªth, and now, having left the From Book to Game team, I've a chance to pursue it. It's going to have a far more sullen mood about it, and probably more brutal deaths than those of the original, as the chapters which describe Numenor are rather negative. I've already worked out the tech trees, factions and heroes (not yet the Special Powers), the UI, and most of the new Living World Map, and I understand the mass of the project, however, I want to keep it as an 'expansion', meaning I don't want to go overboard with new gaming systems or the like.

The proposed factions are, thus far:

- Mordor

- Black Numenoreans


- Elves

- Dunedain
